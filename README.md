 Each game of dragonfire uses ONE adventure of our choosing with each scene divided into rounds. 
 
    Adventure card DICTATES the setup of the game and MAY have seperate constraints from other cards.
    ENCOUNTERS determine which monsters players will face during the game. 
    - Build primary and secondary ENCOUNTER decks and place near the party leader.
    The adventure will list how many encounters will appear at the beginning of each scene. 
    - There is a SPECIFIC order in which ENCOUNTERS ARE SEEN
        REVEAL encounters from the SECONDARY deck based off of the dragonfire LEVEL(Equal to number of cards in the DISCARD)
        ^ Skip first card on first turn. 
        REVEAL encounters based off of the ADVENTURE from the PRIMARY ENCOUNTER deck. 
        
        PLACE the encounter card in front of the player whose class corresponds to the ENCOUNTER card. 
          - After the first encounter card is placed, place encounters to the left, regardless of the class.
